      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>Javaminions was founded in 1921 by Hyunhee Cho. </p>
      <p>At the time, Hyunhee was a young football player who had just
        finished a career year. He would go onto being the first billionaire football
        player, businessman and major investor.</p>
      <h3>JavaMinions early life</h3>
      <p>As his first challenge was complete, Hyunhee decided that it was time to step
      up his game. He reached out to all the major financial institutes and with a whopping
      $27.82 he started the company we all love and admire: <b>JavaMinions</b>.
      Hyunhee would need help to start this new franchise so he reached out to an old family friend.</p>
      <h3>Queen Becca the 3rd</h3>
      <p>As Hyunhee marched with his army to the front lines, he remembered what his uncle had told him:
        <i>"Sometimes you eat the bar, sometimes the bar. Well ... he eats you!"</i> Those words
      resonated in Hyunhee's ear but he remembered that his enemies were just above the hill. Queen Becca
      had summoned the royal army led by Ryan The Thtrong, Hyunhee had brought peasants who would gladly sacrifice
      themselves for the greater good. </p>
      <p><i>"March idiot !"</i> he yelled at his buffoon. Christian the juggler was no ordinary buffoon, he was
      dropped on his head repeatedly as a child to induce a high level of intelligence. The plan had backfired on
      his parents and instead of high intelligence he suffered massive brain damage. They ended up just ditching him on the side of the road where Hyunhee picked him up.</p>
      <p>The sky was clear, all were ready. Swords clinging, men chanting, buffoons buffooning when suddenly the sky darkened.
      <i>"Take cover idiots!"</i> he yelled at his men. A swarm of arrows covered the sun and came down on ... wait a second.
      This is supposed to be an about us page. Oh well, you get the gist of it, right ?</p>
