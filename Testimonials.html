      <h2><i>"They Set The Industry Standard" - Jake</i></h2>
      <p>I hired JavaMinions in spring of 1935 during the great internet boom.
      Our company was growing at a very fast pace and we needed help with payment processing.
      They started working right away, "No need to plan, just code" is what Christian kept repeating.
      It felt very special seeing them copy and paste stack overflow posts until things worked. We
      talk about trial and error but you haven't seen it at this level until you see the speed at which
      the code fails and they just move on. <br>Anyway after they created the site we started processing payments,
      it was a little buggy at first and there were massive security breaches. We lost all of our sales and within a week
      someone hacked our servers and stole all of our money. When the FBI took over the case they said that they set the
      industry standard for what not to do. <br><br>Jake</p>

      <h2><i>"True Professionals" - Michael</i></h2>
      <p>When I hired JavaMinions we were behind on a few projects
      so we needed to outsource our work. The team presented themselves
      as senior semi-experienced junior developers, we didn't think
      twice about the title they were giving themselves however in
      hindsight we should have paid more attention.<br>
      The project involved simply attaching a website to a database, we could have
      had our main team do it but they were busy with the rollout of our next
      self-driving RC Car. Long story short we lost all of our data as well as
      backups. We're filing for bankruptcy as we speak, my dream is gone and
      my wife keeps repeating that I should have hired true professionals instead
      of these guys.<br><br>Michael</p>
